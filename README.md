# The Data Exploration App

The point of this R Shiny app is to provide a point-and-click GUI to perform basic data exploration,
leveraging the reporting capabilities of the `arsenal` package and the plotting capabilities of the
`ggplot2` package. It is available at https://rtools.mayo.edu/data_exploration/.

This project is actively under development, and any contributions are welcome on GitHub. For news,
